===================

Problem Context
===================
Our story is set in the planet of Lengaburu......in the distant, distant galaxy
of Tara B. And our protagonists are King Shan, Queen Anga & their family.
King Shan is the emperor of Lengaburu and has been ruling the planet for
the last 350 years (they have long lives in Lengaburu, you see!). Let's write
some code to get to know the family. 

Procedure to Test
===================

1. Clone the project in local system
2. Open cmd in KingShanFamilyTree directory
3. Make sure a C++ compiler is already installed in your local system (e.g: MinGW)
4. Enter command to compile (e.g: g++ -o KingShanFamily main.cpp)
5. Write a file with your commands to use as an input file
6. Enter command with input file name (and path if exists in different directory) to run the program (e.g: KingShanFamily.exe input_data.txt)
